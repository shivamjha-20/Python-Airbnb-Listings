Airbnb Dataset Analysis

1. Data Source:

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Airbnb and contains information about various listings, including property types, neighborhoods, prices, and other relevant details.
2. Data Exploration:

Displayed the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
Examined the data types of each column to identify categorical and numerical variables.
Provided basic statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for numerical columns.
3. Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values by filling missing numeric values with the column mean and categorical values with a new category, 'Unknown'.
Ensured data integrity and completeness by addressing missing values appropriately.
4. Basic Statistics:

Calculated the average price of Airbnb listings to gain insight into the overall pricing trends.
Explored the distribution of property types and neighborhoods to understand the diversity of listings available.
5. Visualization:

Visualized the distribution of prices using a histogram to understand the range and frequency of listing prices.
Plotted count distributions of property types and neighborhoods to visualize the popularity of different listing categories and locations.
6. Correlation Analysis:

Conducted correlation analysis to explore relationships between numerical variables such as price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap to identify potential correlations among features.
7. Data Insights:

Identified key insights such as the average price of listings, distribution of property types, and popular neighborhoods.
Explored correlations between different features to understand how they may influence listing prices.
8. Documentation:

Documented the project, including data source, steps taken (data collection, exploration, cleaning, visualization, and analysis), and insights gained.
Provided a brief description of the project's objectives and methodologies used to analyze the Airbnb dataset effectively.
